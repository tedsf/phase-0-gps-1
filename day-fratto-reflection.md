#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* Working through the git workflow without help.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* The git workflow process in action.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* The difference between merging locally (then pushing the master to github) versus pushing the new branch to github and creating a pull request for the merging of the two branches.

#What still confuses you about Git?
* Well.. I guess how it actually saves the previous versions? "whats in the git folder???"

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* Loved it! Was nervous going in but my pair and the guide did a great job making sure it all went smoothly!
