What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the correct process of when to branch, add, commit, and push. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Seeing why we would create a new branch and commit in a practical application really helped. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We asked Charlotte a lot about merging, I remember that.

What still confuses you about Git?
I feel like it still feels like a lot of extra steps. Maybe I'm not visualizing it correctly.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think it was awesome! We were both really enthusiastic and it was nice to have a guide in case we got stuck. It felt good to bounce ideas off each other.
